:providers:
# :providers:
#
# This section contains the VM providers for VMs and Pools
# The currently supported backing services are:
# - vsphere
# - dummy
# - gce
#
#   - provider_class
#     For multiple providers, specify one of the supported backing services (vsphere or dummy or gce)
#     (optional: will default to it's parent :key: name eg. 'gce')
#
#   - purge_unconfigured_resources
#     Enable purging of VMs detected
#     For GCE: by default any VM in the project but without a "pool" label, or a "pool" label with the value for an unconfigured pool
#     An optional allowlist can be provided to ignore purging certain folders or pool labels
#
#     Setting this on the provider will enable purging for the provider
#     Expects a boolean value
#     (optional; default: false)
#
#   - recources_allowlist
#     For GCE: Specify pool labels that should be ignored when purging VMs, for pools that are not configured. For example if the label is
#     set to 'pool=donotdelete' and there is no pool with that name configured, adding "donotdelete" to the allowlist would not purge the VM.
#     adding "" (empty string) to the allowlist has a special meaning whereas VMs that do not have the "pool" label are also not purged.
#     This option is only evaluated when 'purge_unconfigured_folders' is enabled
#     Expects an array of strings specifying the allowlisted labels by name
#     (optional; default: nil)
#
# If you want to support more than one provider with different parameters (server, username or passwords) you have to specify the
# backing service in the provider_class configuration parameter for example 'vsphere' or 'dummy'. Each pool can specify
# the provider to use.
#
# Multiple providers example:

  :gce1:
    provider_class: 'gce'
    project: 'myproject'
    zone: 'us-central1-f'
  :gce2:
    provider_class: 'gce'
    project: 'myproject-foo'
    zone: 'us-central1-f'

# :gce:
#
# This section contains the global variables for the gce provider
# some of them can be overwritten at the pool level
#
# Available configuration parameters:
#
#   - project
#     The GCE project name to use when creating/deleting resources
#     (required)
#   - zone
#     The GCE zone name to use when creating/deleting resources (vms, disks etc)
#     Can be overwritten at the pool level
#     (required)
#   - machine_type
#     Full or partial URL of the machine type resource to use for this instance, in the format: zones/zone/machineTypes/machine-type
#     (required)
#   - network_name
#     The GCE network_name to use
#     (required)
# Example:

  :gce:
    project: 'myproject'
    zone: 'us-central1-f'
    machine_type: ''
    network_name: ''

# :pools:
#
# This section contains a list of virtual machine 'pools' for vmpooler to
# create and maintain.
#
# Available configuration parameters (per-pool):
#
#   - name
#     The name of the pool.
#     (required)
#
#   - alias
#     Other names this pool can be requested as.
#     (optional)
#
#   - template
#     The template or virtual machine target to spawn clones from. eg projects/debian-cloud/global/images/family/debian-9
#     (required)
#
#   - size
#     The number of waiting VMs to keep in a pool.
#     (required)
#
#   - provider
#     The name of the VM provider which manage this pool.  This should match
#     a name in the :providers: section above e.g. vsphere
#     (required; will default to vsphere for backwards compatibility)
#     If you have more than one provider, this is where you would choose which
#     one to use for this pool
#
#   - clone_target
#     Per-pool option to override the global 'clone_target' cluster.
#     (optional)
#
#   - timeout
#     How long (in minutes) before marking a clone in 'pending' queues as 'failed' and retrying.
#     This setting overrides any globally-configured timeout setting.
#     (optional; default: '15')
#
#   - ready_ttl
#     How long (in minutes) to keep VMs in 'ready' queues before destroying.
#     (optional; default: no limit)
#
#   - check_loop_delay_min (optional; default: 5) seconds
#   - check_loop_delay_max (optional; default: same as check_loop_delay_min) seconds
#   - check_loop_delay_decay (optional; default: 2.0) Must be greater than 1.0
#     See the :config: section for information about these settings
#
#   Provider specific pool settings
#
#     Gce provider
#     - zone
#       The zone to create the VMs in
#       (optional: default is global provider zone value)
#     - machine_type
#       Full or partial URL of the machine type resource to use for this instance, in the format: zones/zone/machineTypes/machine-type
# Example:

:pools:
  - name: 'debian-8-x86_64'
    alias: [ 'debian-8-64', 'debian-8-amd64' ]
    template: 'global/images/my-custom-image'
    size: 5
    timeout: 15
    ready_ttl: 1440
    provider: gce
    zone: 'us-new-zone'
    machine_type: 'zones/us-central1-f/machineTypes/n1-standard-1'
